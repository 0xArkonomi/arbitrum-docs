title: "Quickstart: Launch an Orbit appchain (Experimental)"
description: "Launch your own Orbit appchain using Arbitrum Nitro codebase's new license. Settle to Arbitrum's L2 chains via bridge contracts on the underlying L2 chain (One or Nova). No need for permission from the Arbitrum DAO or Offchain Labs to create your Orbit appchain. Modify the Nitro codebase freely for your appchain. Stay tuned for more information."
