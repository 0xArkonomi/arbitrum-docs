_**Note: before interacting with a mainnet chain, users should familiarize themselves with the risks; see [Mainnet Beta](mainnet-beta)**_.

_**This tutorial assumes you have already downloaded a web3 wallet like MetaMask, and that you have Ether or a token in that wallet on the Ethereum mainnet. If you don’t have a wallet, visit [portal page](https://portal.arbitrum.one/) to download one.**_




#### 1- Add a Network

To start using the Arbitrum bridge, you need to add the desired chain's RPC endpoint to your wallet. Here, we provide an example for doing this using the MetaMask wallet.
You need to first click on the metamask extension on your browser, click Metamask's network selector dropdown, and then click the `Add Network` button. 
Click "Add a network manually" and then provide the information corresponding the the Arbitrum chain you want to connect to:

##### Nitro Goerli Rollup Testnet:
- Network Name: `Arbitrum Goerli`
- New RPC URL: `https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc`
- Chain ID: `421613`
- Currency Symbol: `AGOR`
- Block Explorer URL: `https://goerli.arbiscan.io`

##### Arbitrum One:
- Network Name: `Arbitrum One`
- New RPC URL: `https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc`
- Chain ID: `42161`
- Currency Symbol: `ETH`
- Block Explorer URL: `https://arbiscan.io`

##### Arbitrum Nova:
- Network Name: `Arbitrum Nova`
- New RPC URL: `https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc`
- Chain ID: `42170`
- Currency Symbol: `ETH`
- Block Explorer URL: `https://nova.arbiscan.io/`

If you’re a developer you can also rely on some popular third party node providers to interact with public Arbitrum chain, see the list [here](node_running/node-providers.mdx).

#### 2- Bridge Your ETH/Tokens (L1 → L2)

To move your Ether and tokens to Arbitrum chains, visit [bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). 
Login to the bridge with your wallet and make sure you are connected to the Ethereum mainnet network.
Now choose the desired network you wish to bridge to, e.g., Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. Note that Arbitrum Goerli only appears if you are connected to the Goerli network rather than the Ethereum Mainnet.

![Add the desired Arbitrum Network to your MetaMask wallet](assets/getting_started_users_2.png)

Select the token you want to bridge in the token drop-down menu. You can also enable/disable the token lists by clicking `Manage Token lists` button on the bottom right corner of the drop-down menu.

Enter the amount of ETH/tokens you want to bridge over in the “Mainnet” field and then press `deposit`. Follow the prompts on Metamask.

After you submit the transaction through Metamask you can expect your funds to arrive on Arbitrum One within roughly 10 minutes to an hour (depending on congestion).

Also make sure your MetaMask wallet is set to the Arbitrum One network  OR the Arbitrum Nova network (depending on which one you chose to bridge to) so you can see your funds when they arrive.

You can also enable/disable token lists by clicking on the “Manage Token lists” button on the bottom right corner of the drop-down menu.
#### 1- Connect Your Wallet

Connect [your wallet](https://portal.arbitrum.one/#wallets) to an Arbitrum chain, adding the chain's RPC endpoint if required.

#### Get Some Native Currency

You'll need a chain's native currency to transact. You can either acquire funds directly on an Arbitrum chain, or get funds on a chain's underlying L1 and bridge it across. You can get testnet Ether from the following faucets:

- [Goerli](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
- [Nitro Goerli Rollup](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ok%20I%20need%20@arbitrum%20to%20give%20me%20Arbitrum%20Goerli%20testnet%20gas.%20I%20can't%20wait%20to%20start%20developing%20on%20@nitro_devnet.%20%20SEND%20HERE:%200xAddA0B73Fe69a6E3e7c1072Bb9523105753e08f8)

[Supported centralized exchanges](https://portal.arbitrum.one/#centralizedexchanges) allow you to purchase (mainnet) Ether and withdraw it directly onto Arbitrum one.

#### Deposit And Withdraw

To move your Ether and Tokens between Arbitrum and Ethereum chains, visit [bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/).

#### Use L2 Dapps!

Interacting with Arbitrum chains will feel very similar to using Ethereum, just cheaper and faster! To get a sense of what's out there, you can check out our [portal page](https://portal.arbitrum.one/), where we showcase some of the dApps, wallets, and infrastructure currently live on Arbitrum One.

#### Build on Arbitrum

Dapp developers can [build on Arbitrum seamlessly](getting-started-devs) using their favorite Ethereum tooling.

#### What's Next

The team working on Arbitrum is always interested and looking forward to engage with its users.
