## Add Orbit Testnet Chain to the Arbitrum Bridge 

The following steps will walk you through adding an Orbit Testnet chain to the Arbitrum Bridge 

Prerequisites 
- Orbit Local Devnet Chain (to create a Orbit Local Devnet Chain follow the steps in https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart) 

1. Navigate to https://bridge.arbitrum.io/

2. Connect to Arbitrum Goerli or Sepolia and the bridge page will automatically switch to the correct testnet view

3. If you are connected to mainnet, and don’t switch networks manually in your wallet, then you can enable testnet mode in the bridge by clicking on your address in the top right --> clicking "settings" --> and then "turn on testnet mode".

4. Go to settings and scroll down to “Add testnet Orbit chain"
