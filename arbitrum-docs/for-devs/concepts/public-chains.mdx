Arbitrum chains are Layer 2 solutions built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, designed to increase scalability and reduce costs. In this conceptual overview, we’ll learn about the different Arbitrum chains and how they relate to each other. We’ll describe the available Arbitrum production and testnet chains, their differences, and the technology stacks that these chains use. We will finally list the current validators in each chain, as well as the members of the data availability committee (DAC) in Arbitrum Nova.

## What Arbitrum production chains are available?

### Arbitrum One

**Arbitrum One** is the flagship Arbitrum mainnet chain, an optimistic rollup chain running on top of Ethereum mainnet. It offers a unique combination of benefits including trustless security, compatibility with Ethereum, scalability, and minimum cost. It uses the [Nitro](/inside-arbitrum-nitro/inside-arbitrum-nitro.mdx) technology stack, which is a major upgrade of the technology, improving over the "Classic" stack in several ways such as advanced calldata compression, separate contexts for common execution and fault proving, Ethereum L1 gas compatibility, and more.

### Arbitrum Nova

**Arbitrum Nova** is another production chain that uses the AnyTrust technology stack, a variant use case of the Nitro technology. In general, AnyTrust lowers costs by accepting a mild trust assumption. Instead of requiring all Arbitrum nodes to have access to the data of every L2 transaction in the Arbitrum chain's inbox, AnyTrust relies on an external Data Availability Committee to store data and provide it on demand, reducing the costs of batching and posting all L2 transaction data to L1.

## What Arbitrum testnet chains are available?

### Arbitrum Goerli

Arbitrum Goerli is a testnet chain that mirrors the functionality of the Arbitrum One mainnet. It's connected to the Ethereum Goerli testnet, allowing developers to test their smart contracts in a risk-free environment before deploying them on the mainnet.

⚠️ The old testnet RinkArby was deprecated on December 20th, 2022.

## What differences there are between the available Arbitrum chains?

The main differences between the Arbitrum chains lie in their purpose and the environment they operate in.

Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova are production chains designed for real-world use. They're connected to the Ethereum mainnet and handle real, valuable transactions. They use the Nitro and AnyTrust technology stacks respectively, offering different sets of features and benefits. Arbitrum One is designed for general use, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for running Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. On the other hand, Arbitrum Nova is designed for applications that require a higher transaction throughput and don’t require the full decentralization that rollups provide.

Finally, Arbitrum Goerli is a testnet chain. It's designed for testing purposes and is connected to the Ethereum Goerli testnet, which uses test Ether with no real-world value.

## What technology stacks use Arbitrum chains?

### Nitro

Nitro is the protocol that powers Arbitrum One. It's designed to offer high throughput and low cost, making it ideal for scaling Ethereum applications. Nitro is a major upgrade to the “Classic” stack, offering several improvements  including advanced calldata compression, separate contexts for common execution and fault proving, Ethereum L1 gas compatibility, and more. You can find more information about Nitro in [Inside Arbitrum Nitro](/inside-arbitrum-nitro/inside-arbitrum-nitro.mdx).

### AnyTrust

AnyTrust is a variant of the Nitro technology stack that lowers costs by accepting a mild trust assumption. The AnyTrust protocol relies on an external Data Availability Committee (DAC) to store data and provide it on demand. The DAC has N members, of which AnyTrust assumes at least two are honest. Keeping the data off-chain in the happy/common case means the system can charge the user significantly lower fees. You can find more information about AnyTrust in [Inside AnyTrust](/inside-anytrust.mdx).

### Classic (deprecated)

The Classic technology stack is the original version of Arbitrum. It has been deprecated and replaced by the Nitro technology stack in the Arbitrum One chain.
