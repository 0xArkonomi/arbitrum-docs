**Third-party docs** are documents that help readers of Arbitrum docs use other products, services, and protocols (like the ones listed in the [Arbitrum portal](https://portal.arbitrum.io/)) with Arbitrum products.

These documents are usually authored by partner teams, but can be authored by anyone. They follow the same general process that [core docs](/for-devs/contribute#add-a-new-core-document) follow, embedded here for convenience:
