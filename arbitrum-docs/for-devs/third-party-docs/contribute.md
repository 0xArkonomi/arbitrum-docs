**Third-party docs** are documents that help readers of Arbitrum docs use other products, services, and protocols (like the ones listed in the [Arbitrum portal](https://portal.arbitrum.io/)) with Arbitrum products.

These documents are usually authored by partner teams, but can be authored by anyone. They follow the same general process that [core docs](/for-devs/contribute#add-a-new-core-document) follow, embedded here for convenience:

import ContributeCoreDocsPartial from '../../partials/_contribute-core-docs-partial.md';

Third-party docs contributors are asked to follow these guidelines as well (in addition to the above):

import ContributeThirdPartyDocsPartial from '../../partials/_contribute-third-party-docs-partial.md';

<ContributeThirdPartyDocsPartial />
