The following [Oracles](../../for-devs/concepts/oracles.mdx) will help you integrate off-chain data into your decentralized apps (dApps):

## Chainlink

[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is a widely-recognized Web3 services platform that specializes in decentralized oracle networks. It allows developers to create versatile Web3 applications that can effortlessly connect to real-world data and off-chain computation on Arbitrum and many other blockchain networks. Chainlink offers a variety of data feeds, including asset prices, weather data, random number generation, and many more.

You can find an example on how to use Chainlink in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## API3

[API3](https://api3.org/) is a collaborative project to deliver traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. API3 provides the technology for Airnodes to push off-chain data to on-chain contracts. This data can then be queried directly through the Airnode (initiating a “pull-type” request) or through dAPIs (datafeeds of up-to-date off-chain data).

You can find an example on how to use API3 in your project in [this page](../../devs-how-tos/how-to-use-oracles.mdx).

## Tellor

[Tellor](https://tellor.io/) is a decentralized oracle network that incentivizes an open, permissionless network of data reporting and validation, ensuring that any verifiable data can be brought on-chain. It supports basic spot prices, sophisticated pricing specs (TWAP/VWAP), Snapshot Vote Results, and custom data needs.
