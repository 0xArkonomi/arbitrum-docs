1.  Begin by creating a branch of the [Arbitrum docs repo](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs).
2.  Issue a `Draft` pull request from your branch into `master`. Pull requests into `master` generate a preview of your changes via a branch-specific Docusaurus deployment; this preview will update as you push commits to your remote branch.
3.  Include answers to the following questions in your PR description:
    ```markdown
    1. Audience: Who am I writing for?
    2. Problem: What specific problem are they trying to solve?
    3. Discovery: How are they looking for a solution to this problem? What search terms are they using?
    4. Document type: Which document type is most suitable?
    5. Validated demand: How do we know that this documentation is actually needed?
    6. Policy acknowledgment (Third-party docs only): Do you agree to the third-party content policy outlined within "Contribute docs"?
    ```
4.  As you craft your contribution, refer to the [document types](#document-type-conventions), [Style guidance](#style-conventions), and other conventions below.
5.  Mark your PR as `Open` when it's ready for review.
