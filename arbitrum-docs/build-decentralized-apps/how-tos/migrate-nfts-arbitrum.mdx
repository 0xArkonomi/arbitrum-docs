This how-to is for **developers** who want to migrate existing <a data-quicklook-from="non-fungible-tokens-nfts">NFT</a> collections from Ethereum mainnet to <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> or <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Nova</a>. This guidance applies to NFT collections that support web3 games, decentralized apps (dApps), and other use-cases.

### Prerequisites

 - An NFT collection that's minted and managed by smart contracts on Ethereum mainnet. (todo - align on whether we want to include non-EVM chains here)
 - NFTs that are implemented using the ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token standards[^1].


:::info

ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens **cannot be migrated to Arbitrum via [bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)**. The Arbitrum Bridge only supports ERC-20 tokens.

For guidance on how to migrate ERC-20 tokens to Arbitrum, see [How to bridge ERC-20 tokens to Arbitrum](#todo) instead.

## Why should I migrate my project's NFTs to Arbitrum?

<!-- todo: this can be moved to a dedicated concept doc -->

There are three main reasons to migrate your your project's NFTs to Arbitrum:

 1. **Low fees**. NFTs hosted by one of Arbitrum's chains can be minted, transfered, and traded at a much lower cost compared to Ethereum mainnet.
 2. **Fast transactions**. From the end-user's perspective, transactions on Arbitrum's chains are processed more quickly than they are on Ethereum mainnet. This lets you build NFT-powered experiences that feel just about as fast as traditional apps and games.
 3. **Interoperability with the Ethereum ecosystem**. If you're migrating your project's NFTs from other non-Ethereum chains, migration to Arbitrum will let your users freely carry their NFTs across application boundaries within the Ethereum ecosystem.

<!-- todo: when shouldn't you? Risks to call out? -->


## How do I migrate my project's NFTs to Arbitrum?

There are a number of options to choose from, each with its own tradeoffs:

1. **Set up cross-chain messaging between an old NFT contract to a new one on Arbitrum.** (todo - summary of tradeoffs - eg high engineering cost; seamless and unobtrusive UX for end-users)
2. **Mint a new collection on Arbitrum and distribute NFTs to existing holders.** (todo)
3. **Build contracts on Arbitrum that depend on NFT ownership from other EVM chains.** (todo)
4. **Building your own NFT Bridge.** (todo)


### Option 1: Set up cross-chain messaging between an old NFT contract to a new one on Arbitrum

Choose this option if...

Here are the steps to take / the docs to follow:


### Option 2: Mint a new collection on Arbitrum and distribute NFTs to existing holders

Choose this option if...

Here are the steps to take / the docs to follow:


### Option 3: Build contracts on Arbitrum that depend on NFT ownership from other EVM chains

Choose this option if...

Here are the steps to take / the docs to follow:


### Option 4: Build your own NFT Bridge

Choose this option if you want to migrate your NFT collection to <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> or <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Nova</a> without introducing additional third-party trust assumptions. 

The below workshop was hosted by a blockchain engineer at Offchain Labs, and walks you through the process of building your own trustless ERC-721 bridge.

# Latest draft content to incorporate into the above structure

## Migrate NFTs using third-party NFT bridging solutions
 
This option is ideal if you want to migrate your NFT collection to <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-one">Arbitrum One</a> or <a data-quicklook-from="arbitrum-nova">Nova</a> as quickly as possible.

There are many things to consider before using a third-party bridging solution, including:

 - Token metadata
 - Royalty mechanisms
 - Perception of which chain's NFTs are canonical
 - Representational clashes if multiple bridges are used for the same collection
 - etc

One of the most notable considerations is that **using a third-party bridging solution may introduce new trust assumptions**. Consider your tradeoffs carefully when deciding to use any of the below solutions, and proceed with caution.

This list does not represent an endorsement or recommendation; it's simply a list of options that are available, shared with the expectation that you'll **do your own research before using them**:

- [Axelar](https://axelar.network/)
    - Currently live on Arbitrum One for ERC721 and ERC1155
- [Layer Zero](https://layerzero.network/)
    - Currently live on Arbitrum One for ERC721 and ERC1155
- [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/)
    - Currently live on Arbitrum One for ERC721
- [XP Network](https://xp.network/)
    - Currently live on Arbitrum Nova for ERC721 and ERC1155


### Other third-party solutions

There are some third-party solutions that give you the best of both worlds: **canonical representation of foundational NFTs on their original chain**, *and* **Arbitrum's scaling capabilities to facilitate fast and cheap experiences**:

 - **Pirate Nation** has implemented a solution they coined as **[mirroring](https://piratenation.medium.com/mirroring-trade-on-l1-play-on-l2-3f53068a6a44)**, which allows users to trade NFTs on Ethereum and play with the mirrored versions of those NFTs on Arbitrum Nova. The NFTs on Nova's L2 chain can be transferred by a custodial central entity, but the NFTs on L1 remain fully self-custodial. This solution entirely avoids the need for bridging.
 - **0xEssential**'s [NFT Global Entry](https://docs.0xessential.com/0xessential/guides/nft-global-entry) offers a similar solution by hosting a public oracle that generates ownership proofs; these proofs can be easily consumed and used by their SDK.



[^1]: Although ERC-20 tokens are fungible (mutually exchangeable with no expectation of uniqueness between tokens), they can *technically* be (and have been) used to represent ownership of unique digital assets. For example, CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks were originally implemented as ERC-20 tokens with additional code that made each token uniquely identifiable. This use-case demonstrated a new way to extend the ERC-20 spec, and eventually led to the [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) standard, which now offers protocol-canonical support for NFTs.
