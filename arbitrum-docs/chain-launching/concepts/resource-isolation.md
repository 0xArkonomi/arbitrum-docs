 - Running your dApp on a custom Orbit chain isolates your dApp's activity from other projects (eg those using Arbitrum L2 chains or Ethereum Mainnet directly)
   -  This is almost fully true with anytrust, but somewhat less true with arbitrum rollup where the data needs to be posted to the underlying chain. With rollup it’s still verify helpful, but doesn’t isolate you completely
 - Running your dApp on a custom Orbit chain significantly increases resource availability, so you don’t need to compete for computation and storage resources
   - “Further, anytrust chains isolates your data throughput as well” or something along those lines
